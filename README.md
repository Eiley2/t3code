# T3 Code

T3 Code is a minimal web GUI for coding agents. Currently Codex-first, with Claude Code support coming soon.

## How to use

> [!WARNING]
> You need to have [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and authorized for T3 Code to work.

```bash
npx t3
```

You can also just install the desktop app. It's cooler.

Install the [desktop app from the Releases page](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/releases)
